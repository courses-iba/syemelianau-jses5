# JSES5 Course hints

# Task Assignments and files to send for review

Task solutions should be provided in specified folders with specified file names

    src/Task1/task1.js
	src/Task2/task2.js
	... and so on ...

Create these folders/files if needed.	

Files contained in 'test' foldel should be RENAMED accordingly to provided solution files:

	test/Task1/test_task1.disabled 		=> 		test/Task1/test_task1.js
	... and so on ...

# NOTE!!! Even if you have all the tasks for currently studying chapter accessible - you should still send for a review only (!!!) current task, following the rule "one task = one commit".

# Testing and debugging

Run 'npm install' , 'npm test' in the repository root catalog to perform unit testing locally.

Install 'sonarlint' plugin to your Eclipse environment (if used) - this will allow to cover the most part of rules to follow to have SonarQube quality gate passed. You could also connect your local environment to SonarQube server to follow up not just to common rules but to all the rules applying to your code while testing it on server enviroment.

# If any questions appear

Ask assigned tutor if you have any questions regarding the course.
